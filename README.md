# UTP
This repo contains 2 scripts that allow you to manipulate Undertale savefiles. This will allow you to
- Refight old bosses by saving the state before the bossfight
- Play multiple games concurrently
- Bypass the consequences of a Genocide Route
This repo also contains multiple savefiles from my own playthroughs


## Run Instructions
Your Undertale game (ie `Undertale.exe`) should be inside a directory called `Undertale`. Move `Undertale` into this directory and double-click `Start Undertale.bat`
