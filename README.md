# UTP
This repo contains 2 scripts that allow you to manipulate Undertale savefiles. This will allow you to
- Refight old bosses by saving the state before the bossfight
- Play multiple games concurrently
- Bypass the consequences of a Genocide Route

This repo also contains multiple savefiles from my own playthroughs
